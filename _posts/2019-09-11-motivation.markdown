Alright, alright, alright!
<br>

First words ever said on film.
<br>

1992, Dazed and Confused. The first words i ever said on film were "All right, all right, all right!"
<br>

If i start with "All right, all right, all right!" and "Thank you.", i really can't go wrong.
<br>

When i was 15 years old, i had very important person in my life come to me and say, "Who's your hero?" and i said, "I don't know. I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks".
<br>

I come back two weeks later. This person comes up and says, "Who's your hero?".
<br>

I said, "I thought about it. You know who it is? It's me in ten years."
<br>

So i turned 25, ten years later, that same person comes to me and go, "So are you a hero?". And i was like, "Not even close. No no no."
<br>

She said "Why?".
<br>

I said, "Because my hero's me at 35."
<br>

So, you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away.
<br>

I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that. I know i'm not and that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing.
<br>

So, to any of us, whatever those things are, whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to and whoever it is we're chasing, to that i say "Amen.".
<br>

To that i say, "Alright, alright, alright."
<br>

To that i say, "Just keep living."
<br>

Thank you
