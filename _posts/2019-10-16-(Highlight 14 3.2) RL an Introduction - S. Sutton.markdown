### 3.2 Goals and Rewards
The purpose or goal of the agent is formalized in terms of a special signal, called the reward, passing from the environment to the agent. The agent's goal is to maximize the total amount of reward it reveives.
<br>

The reward hypothesis:
<div class="box">
That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought or as the maximization of the expected valueof the cumulative sum of a reveived scalar signal(reward).
</div>

The use of a reward signal to formalize the idea of a goal is one of the most distinctive features of reinforcement learning.
<br>

Although formulating goals in terms of reward signals might at first appear limiting, in practice it has proved to be flexible and widely applicable.
<br>

If we want it to do something for us, we must provide rewards to it in such a way that in maximizing them the agent will also achieve our goals. It is thus critical that the rewards we set up truly indicate what we want accomplished.
